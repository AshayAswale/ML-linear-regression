Part 2 writeup:

For the part 2 of 'Make predictions by using your implementation', I settled on these values:
alpha: 0.95
n_epoch: 10

With these values, these are the results I got:
training loss: 5.716343363218136e-06
testing loss: 11646.363558768067

It is possible that with the training loss that low, the model might have overfit, but with the changes in the 
alpha value, the testing loss did not change much. so I decided to minimise the training loss to the lowest possible value. 

The testing loss in the trained model is very high, so we can conclude that the trained model is not even close to 
the desired state and the predicted values are way off the actual values.

I tested the values one at a time. First I fixed the value of the n_epoch to 50 then played with the alpha value:
alpha: 0.01     training loss: 2506.2437
alpha: 0.50     training loss: 4.800 e-15
alpha: 1        training loss: 7.858 e-29
alpha: 5        training loss: 3.265 e+82

As we see here, there is a steep parabollic behaviour, so we fine tuned the value to get the reported alpha value. 

Now for the n_epoch values, we fixed the alpha value to 1 (for simplicity), but this time we also saw the testing loss
as only the training loss was too small to conclude anything.
(In this case, I am using the model trained for the training dataset, then predicting its values for the testing, 
and then using these values to tell the testing loss)

n_epoch: 1          training loss: 351.021            testing loss: 10770.238674876266

n_epoch: 5          training loss: 0.246              testing loss: 11665.205438722227

n_epoch: 9          training loss: 0.000              testing loss: 11647.624250571947

n_epoch: 10         training loss: 8.410 e-05         testing loss: 11645.981183135733

n_epoch: 11         training loss: 1.732 e-05         testing loss: 11646.788965361475

n_epoch: 25         training loss: 4.417 e-15         testing loss: 11646.558336564032

n_epoch: 50         training loss: 7.858              testing loss: 11646.558332661665


Hence we again see a parabollic behaviour of the n_epoch. Hence I seettled on the n_epoch value of 10 in this case.


With this data, we can also compare the relationship between the n_epoch and the alpha. With the small changes in the 
alpha value, the loss is increased/decreased drastically. But with the changes in n_epoch the values are not affected 
much. Also, after the peak at the n_epoch=10, the values increase but not by a huge value.
